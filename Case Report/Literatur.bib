	abstract = {Critical to an airline's operation is the effective use of its reservations inventory. American Airlines began research in the early 1960s in managing revenue from this inventory. Because of the problem's size and difficulty, American Airlines Decision Technologies has developed a series of OR models that effectively reduce the large problem to three much smaller and far more manageable subproblems: overbooking, discount allocation, and traffic management. The results of the subproblem solutions are combined to determine the final inventory levels. American Airlines estimates the quantifiable benefit at $1.4 billion over the last three years and expects an annual revenue contribution of over $500 million to continue into the future.},

	title = {Optimal Airline Seat Allocation with Fare Classes Nested by Origins and Destinations},
	journal = {Transportation Science},
	volume = {24},
	number = {3},
	pages = {193-204},
	abstract = {Previous research in the optimal allocation of airline seats has followed one of two themes: marginal seat revenue or mathematical programming. Both approaches capture important elements of the revenue management problem. The marginal seat revenue approach accounts for the "nesting" of fare classes in computer reservation systems, but can only control seat inventory by bookings on legs. The mathematical programming approach will handle realistically large problems and will account for multiple origin—destination itineraries and side constraints, but it does not account for fare class nesting in the reservation systems. This paper combines both approaches by developing equations to find the optimal allocation of seats when fare classes are nested on an origin—destination itinerary and the inventory is not shared among origin—destinations. These results are applicable to seat allocation in certain reservations systems, point-of-sale control, and acceptance of groups over their entire itinerary. A special case of the analysis produces the optimal booking limits for leg-based seat allocation with nested fare classes.},

	abstract = {Revenue management (RM) refers to the collection of strategies and tactics firms use to scientifically manage demand for their products and services. It has gained attention recently as one of the most successful application areas of operations research (OR). The practice has grown from its origins as a relatively obscure practice among a handful of major airlines in the postderegulation era in the United States (circa 1978) to its status today as a mainstream business practice with a growing list of industry users, ranging from Walt Disney Resorts to National Car Rental. The economic impact of RM is significant, with increases in revenue of 5% or more reported in several industry applications of RM systems. Professional practice and research in the area is also expanding. There are now several major industry RM conferences each year, and published research on the methodology of RM has been growing rapidly. This chapter provides an introduction to this increasingly important subfield of OR. It is based on excerpts from our book The Theory and Practice of Revenue Management [K. T. Talluri and G. J. van Ryzin. The Theory and Practice of Revenue Management. Springer Science + Business Media, Berlin, Germany, 2004.].},

	abstract = {We trace the history of revenue management in an effort to illustrate a successful e-commerce model of dynamic, automated sales. Our discourse begins with a brief overview of electronic distribution as practiced in the airline industry, emphasizing the fundamental role of central reservation and revenue management systems. Methods for controlling the sale of inventory are then introduced along with related techniques for optimization and forecasting. Research contributions and areas of significant research potential are given special attention. We conclude by looking at how revenue management is practiced outside of the airline industry, its relationship to dynamic pricing, and future directions for the discipline. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
